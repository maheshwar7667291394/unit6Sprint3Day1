Q1.

J2EE stands for Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition.
 J2EE is the standard platform for developing applications
 in the enterprise and is designed for enterprise applications
 that run on servers. J2EE provides APIs that let developers
 create workflows and make use of resources such as databases or
 web services. J2EE consists of a set of APIs. Developers can use
 these APIs to build applications for business computing.

Clients can access a J2EE 1.4 application as a remote web service in addition to accessing it through HTTP, RMI/IIOP, and JMS.

Application Server and
Web server
etc.

Q2.

A Web server exclusively handles HTTP requests, 
whereas an application server serves business logic to application programs through any number of protocols.


Q3
there are folowing challange occure for developing enterprise level application
1. Changing Business Requirements
2. Application Security and Control
3. Complex API and Third-Party Integrations
4. Data Storage and Analysis
5. Development Time
6. User Experience (UX)


Q4.


Spring is the most popular application development framework for enterprise Java.
Millions of developers around the world use Spring Framework to create high performing,
easily testable, and reusable code.
Spring framework is an open source Java platform.
It was initially written by Rod Johnson and was first released under the Apache 2.0 license in June 2003.
The core features of the Spring Framework can be used in developing any Java application, but there are 
extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE platform. Spring framework targets to 
make J2EE development easier to use and promotes good programming practices by enabling a POJO-based programming model.



Q5.

class Collage{

private getService s;

// here we  arre using seter and constructor method to use to set for sand the this application will be loosly coupled.

public void doJob(){
System.out.println(”Job is started”);
//here it needs the service of its Dependencies
}
}
Dependencies classes :

class Teacher{



public void teaches Implements getService{
 System.out.println(”Teacher teaches”);
}

@Override
public service(){
teaches();
}


}
class2:
class Clerk  Implemments getService{
public void registerStudent() {
 System.out.println(”enroll the Student in Collage”);
}

@Override
public service(){

 registerStudent();

}
}

public interface getService{

public service();

}
